Hello here is our project called groupie-tracker. This project aims to recover an API and to consume it, the back-end was made in GO, and for the front-end we used templates to display the data of the API all in HTML / CSS. We did this so that if the API is updated, we adapt to the API, and this will not be a problem for us. On our site, the data of the present artists are displayed as well as the important dates. The objective of our site is to have information on artists is a term, to be able to reserve concert tickets or extracts of their greatest titles.
